# Real-Time Room Sharing Setup Guide

## 🚀 Feature Overview

✅ **VERIFIED WORKING** on Vercel production!

The real-time room sharing feature allows players to:
- 📺 **Create rooms** with short codes (ROOM-XXXX)
- 🔗 **Share room codes** for live game viewing  
- ⚡ **Auto-sync** game state every 10 seconds (hosts)
- 👀 **Live viewing** with 5-second polling (viewers)

## 🎯 How It Actually Works (Validated)

### Room Creation Flow
1. User clicks "📺 创建房间"
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/rooms/create` with current game data
3. Vercel Edge Function generates unique ROOM-XXXX code
4. Game data stored in Upstash Redis with 24h TTL
5. Room code displayed in modal with shareable URL
6. Host mode: auto-sync starts (saves to KV every 10s)

### Room Joining Flow  
1. User clicks "🔗 加入房间" or visits `?room=ROOM-XXXX` URL
2. Frontend calls `GET /api/rooms/ROOM-XXXX` to fetch data
3. Game state loaded in read-only mode
4. UI shows green "观看模式" banner with room code
5. Viewer mode: polling starts (checks for updates every 5s)
6. All interactive controls disabled for viewers

### Real-Time Sync Process
1. **Host plays game** → Game state changes locally
2. **Auto-sync triggers** → `PUT /api/rooms/ROOM-XXXX` with new data  
3. **KV stores update** → `lastUpdated` timestamp changes
4. **Viewers poll** → `GET /api/rooms/ROOM-XXXX` returns new data
5. **UI updates automatically** → Shows "🔄 数据已更新" notification

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Vercel KV Database Setup

✅ **Already completed** - You've connected Upstash Redis to Vercel

Your KV credentials are configured in `.env.local`:
```env
KV_REST_API_URL="https://together-mackerel-16791.upstash.io"
KV_REST_API_TOKEN="AUGXAAInc..."
```

### 2. Environment Variables

The following environment variables are automatically available in Vercel:
- `KV_REST_API_URL` - Upstash Redis API endpoint
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` - Authentication token
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN` - Read-only token (for future use)

### 3. API Routes

Created Vercel Edge Functions:
- `api/rooms/create.js` - Create new game room with 24h TTL
- `api/rooms/[code].js` - Get/update room data by room code

## 🎮 How It Works

### Creating a Room (Host)
1. Click **"📺 创建房间"** button
2. System calls `/api/rooms/create` with current game data
3. Generates unique room code (e.g., `ROOM-A1B2`)
4. Stores game state in Vercel KV with 24-hour expiration
5. Returns shareable room code and URL

### Joining a Room (Viewer)
1. Click **"🔗 加入房间"** button  
2. Enter room code or visit URL with `?room=ROOM-XXXX`
3. System fetches data from `/api/rooms/ROOM-XXXX`
4. Loads game state in read-only mode
5. Starts polling every 5 seconds for updates

### Auto-Sync (Host)
- Game state automatically syncs to KV every 10 seconds
- Manual sync triggers on major game events (apply result, advance, etc.)
- Room data includes: teams, scores, history, player stats, current rankings

### Real-Time Updates (Viewers)
- Polls room data every 5 seconds
- Compares `lastUpdated` timestamp to detect changes
- Automatically refreshes UI when new data arrives
- Shows update notifications to viewers

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production (Vercel)
1. Push code to GitHub (✅ Done)
2. Vercel auto-deploys with KV credentials
3. Room feature works immediately on production URL

### Local Development
- Use `vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev` for API support
- APIs available at `http://localhost:3000/api/rooms/*`
- Full room functionality testing requires Vercel dev environment

## 📊 Data Structure

### Room Data Format
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "t1": {"name": "蓝队", "color": "#3b82f6"},
    "t2": {"name": "红队", "color": "#ef4444"},
    "strictA": true
  },
  "state": {
    "t1": {"lvl": "2", "aFail": 0},
    "t2": {"lvl": "2", "aFail": 0},
    "hist": [],
    "roundLevel": "2"
  },
  "players": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "玩家1", "emoji": "🐶", "team": 1}
  ],
  "playerStats": {},
  "currentRanking": {},
  "roomCode": "ROOM-A1B2",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-08-27T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## 💰 Costs & Limits

### Upstash Redis (Free Tier)
- ✅ **10K requests/day** - Perfect for game rooms
- ✅ **256MB storage** - Thousands of concurrent rooms
- ✅ **Global latency** - <10ms read performance
- ✅ **TTL support** - Automatic 24h room expiration

### Usage Estimation
- **Per room:** ~10 requests/minute (host sync + viewer polls)
- **Free tier supports:** 50+ concurrent active rooms
- **Room storage:** ~5-50KB per room depending on game history

## 🔧 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel production (APIs need Vercel environment)
2. Test room creation: click "📺 创建房间"
3. Copy room code, open in incognito/different browser
4. Join room, verify read-only mode
5. Make game moves on host, verify live sync to viewers

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] WebSocket support for instant updates
- [ ] Room participant count and viewer list
- [ ] Room expiration warnings
- [ ] Offline mode detection and recovery
